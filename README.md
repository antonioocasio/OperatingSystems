# OperatingSystems
- The Gaming Room client was a company that wanted to develop a web-based game based on the 80's TV show, Win, Lose or Draw. 

- I believe the best thing that I did well was complete the Java application that we had to do in project 1. I also went over all of the requirements, similarities, and differences between each operating systems and servers.

- The most helpful thing with the design document was being able to visually see what The Gaming Room specifically wanted with their code.

- A document that I would want to revise would be my first software design template that we submitted with project 1. I feel like I could have added more detail with the differences and similarites between the operating systems.

- The way I implemented the users needs was to always make sure that no matter what I had to add in, it would be compatible with any operating system or browers. I also made sure to list out the requirements that they wanted and checked them off as soon as they were implemented. It's important the consider the user's needs so you can make sure that the experience is smooth and they have zero problems with the program.

- The way I approach designing software is to make sure to understand the final requiremnts for that project. It is always best for me to write down exactly what needs to be done and write down the steps that I will take to achieve these requirements.
